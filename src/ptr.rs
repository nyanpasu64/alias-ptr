/// An untracked shared ownership pointer, pointing to heap memory manually freed.
///
/// The type `AliasPtr<T>` provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
/// allocated in the heap. Invoking [`copy`][AliasPtr::copy] on `AliasPtr` produces
/// a new `AliasPtr` instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the
/// source `AliasPtr`. When you call [`delete`][AliasPtr::delete] on any of the copies,
/// the value stored in that allocation is dropped,
/// and all of the copies can no longer be safely dereferenced.
///
/// `AliasPtr` is primarily intended as an unsafe building block for safe abstractions,
/// in order to avoid the runtime overhead of `Rc` or `Arc`
/// in cases where the lifetimes are known statically.
///
/// Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and `AliasPtr`
/// is no exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to
/// something inside an `AliasPtr`. If you need mutability, put a `Cell`/`RefCell`
/// (not thread-safe), `Mutex`/`RwLock`/`Atomic` (thread-safe), or `UnsafeCell`
/// (unsafe API) inside the `AliasPtr`.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// For each `T` on the heap, you are responsible for calling [`delete()`][AliasPtr::delete]
/// on exactly one `AliasPtr` pointing to it,
/// and not dereferencing it or its aliases after.
///
/// In Rust terms, `AliasPtr<T>` acts like a `&T` that allows dangling and deletion,
/// a `Rc<T>` or `Arc<T>` with manual deletion,
/// or like a more convenient raw pointer which is assumed to be valid.
///
/// In C++ terms, `AliasPtr<T>` operates like `T*` or `T const*`, with shared ownership over `T`,
/// where the programmer decides which one to `delete`.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// Since `AliasPtr<T>` only exposes the same set of safe operations as a `&T`
/// ([`delete()`][AliasPtr::delete()] is unsafe),
/// it would technically be sound to expose the same `Send`/`Sync` bounds as `&T`:
/// `impl Send/Sync for AliasPtr<T> where T: Sync`.
///
/// However, I added additional `T: Send` bounds for both `impl Send`/`Sync` (matching `Arc`),
/// as a lint to guard against sending or cloning an `AliasPtr<T>` to another thread,
/// then calling `delete()` there.
///
/// If these bounds are inappropriate for your data structure, you can
/// `unsafe impl Send/Sync` for your type containing `AliasPtr`.
///
/// ## Implementation
///
/// `AliasPtr<T>` has the same size as `&T`, and is interconvertible with a `Box<T>`.
///
/// `AliasPtr` wraps a raw pointer rather than a `&T`,
/// because it's not legal to pass a `&` into `Box::from_raw()`,
/// and a dangling `&` may be UB.
/// See ["How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"](http://blog.pnkfx.org/blog/2021/03/25/how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb/)
/// for details.
